Finger Photo Resolution Analysis 
--------------------------------
Project Class

Objective
--------
we're talking about analyzing of distinct fingerprints. It's all about analyzing fingerprints for identification purposes and memory. Picture this: using it for your smartphones or accessing your bank accounts securely. Now, in our dataset, we've got a total of 256 images. Split that into fingerprint images and ground truth, and each category has 128 images. We're categorizing them into four classes based on resolutions: 5, 8, 13, or 16 megapixels. It's all about precision and security
